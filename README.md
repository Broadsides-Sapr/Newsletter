MATH: OUTSIDE OF ML, LARGELY RELATED ONLY TO GRAPHICS, LOCATION, AND STORAGE... CONCRETE AND SUBJECTIVE... !GENERATION+++!

OOP: MESSY AS HELL. OBJECT TOKENIZATION IS ABOUT AS SIMPLE AS A REPRESENTATIVE "GUID" FOR STORAGE, OBJECTIVE UMBRELLA, OBJECT(S), AND USER

SERVER AND USER SEPERATE CONSIDERATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD... 

GRAPHICS RANGES (PART OF "GUID") EXTRAORDINARILY DOABLE: ~50 COMPONENTS ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT COUNTING 3d, etc, but still... +matrix, lighting, shading, time, and...

BING SEARCH SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE ALL SECURITY BREACHES, WHICH CAN BE FRAMED MATHEMATICALLY TO REPRESENT INDUSTRY STANDARD++, THEN GENERATION ADDS THAT...
CODING PATTERNS RELATIVELY IRRELEVANT ON THE BACK END IF THE EASIER GOTTEN TO INFORMATION FRAMES IT. REST SHOULD BE MUCH EASIER...

With regards to presentation, mobile is fairly much more simple, as a "scramble" type button might be used to
iterate over the X,Y,Z space in reasonable fashion, having a removable simple button with a number on it...
I have been unable to find many iterations of presentation (and I am not talking about ornamentation, so to speak,
simply presentation of major data... so, not shading, etc, but it follows similar derivative pattern) beyond 5
per typical screen. 

Light, Dark is industry standard. Gradient typically built in. Blanket colorings, etc, for gradients typically 
take care of that. Scattered is almost never seen, though contrast appears very relevant. 

CSS, in translation (take the open source Firefox for example), is EVEN MORE complicated. Absolutely not 
worth it, though lots seem to put their heart and soul into it. seems a migration seller, not a 
gainful option for the mission oriented coder. In other words, Geometry and Graphics, established at compile time (tbd),
very much the option. Then again, I'll likely build in the gradients depending on the complexity of the code, TO
the code. More or less keeps the memory locations... 

APIS are ridiculous. I've spent TONS of time on routing, authentication, authorization, and playing whackamole
with the damn data. Lends itself to the concept of ONE Data Model set... a world model, more or less, though
don't forget the "GUID" policy (I say that because easy to think back to hexadecimal, but needs a bit more extension.
Enforcing spacing rules AROUND these items (bounce bounce) takes care of that and maintains the kindness of the 
"Camel case" type polymorphism for code readers. 

Inheritance is another ridiculous concept. Fantastic for READABILITY, but SCOPE ought to be set by the user when
pressing a few buttons on the outset. Boom. Coding has for so long sold itself on what it could be, and yet
we never seem to get to robots. The "extensibility" of code has been somewhat its downfall... no doubt 
exacerbated by the romanticization of the hacker... though I see awful summaries all the time. 

Memory allocation looks like a freezer at a fast food restaurant. If I had to guess I would go back to my statement
that there are few on the venn diagram who went to business school (the MBA is so fast track that I really don't
count that to be business case immersion, though I've seem some smart ones) who are also coders. Project managers
maybe, but... Still taking all the damn stuff outside the freezer and back in again for FIFO 
every time the truck comes in, despite the YOY data shifting, mostly, no more than 10%... 

The standoffish of the coder hurts the forward momentum (there is still a fairly fascinating amount of smoke
and mirrors sprinkled with the bravado of that "but do you know" statement everyone seems to have), but then
again team good guys tends to be standoffish as well... if one gives the keys, does one preemptively kill
an industry that people smart enough can see will mean something until magic comes back to the world...

Those icons of other companies for the "Federation" stuff I think I'll be putting into a dropdown box... should
give me quite a bit more "smoke and mirrors" atmo (see?) for others to think I'm entertaining them, but it 
is in fact the truth, so... maybe if a lot of ID providers show up, my phone OS could offer some kind of choice
on what one might see, assuming ceteris paribus security...

I stand by my philosophy that we need to consider a baseline server system for media, the written word, and
other artistic input... this idea that server farms are going out and out and out is fairly ridiculous UNLESS
the baseline system continually caches and rewrites itself, scrambling itself with itself so that it's like 
attacking the post office... everyone just about has or knows someone that might have something important 
coming through there.

40 or so tries on Ruby, Redis, etc... I'm thinking everyone's wanting me to make my own thing... I got it connected to JetBrains,
but the file system issues ensured I got almost nothing done tonight, though I was proud I finally got a Python
transformer to tell me a coding term haha. 

HTML is hard to let go off for people, it seems... perhaps it's like me telling someone who doesn't know how to code
to go look at a Regex "cheat sheet" for an hour... opens eyes easily... but who isn't tired of hunting down 
divs and columns and whatever new metaphor is invented for CSS flavorization... and I'm disabled, so with my brain
I go back and back and think eventually I'll get to the point, but it never comes (and no, I have not quantified/qualified it, but
I have looked at a massive number of languages, apps, etc, and have a "feel" for non-game graphics at the moment. 

Capcha was great in its day... but I remember studying Tesseract like 15 years ago... I guess the industry 
preferred quiet when it came to the war against hacking... i don't know... haven't really been up on it since Mitnick (RIP)

Pictures of periodically cut off Location trailing Cosine Sims should be much better... 

Data Modeling seems like it needs to do a bit more research into "bits" / "time"  ... the repository pattern 
and these validation methods seem like they're a bit overkill, but I have not looked into it deeply, yet
I know the millisecond, etc, calcs, combined with the SQL Injection and Brute force seemingly out of style, 
is frequently quoted by businesses with rather robust legal teams, IYKWIM.

I find "gait" to be a fairly interesting conversation topic. While Geolocation does have a Y axis, companies
like Google and Apple still point out that the transmission is relatively unreliable... and yet...
I find myself wondering if Bill or someone could find some way Mercury could be measured at the level 
where even without a connection, the two typical modes of "the consumer" could be measured fairly easily (driving/walking)
That said, I don't know if other places have the same issues with theft that we do, so...

Not really much more to do with regards to Utilities, Services, Helpers, etc... 
This "State has Changed" stuff rocked... but it seems it's fairly outdated now, 
as what I call "tracers" are long overdue... but then again, probability and mathematics
seems to be having a rennaisance, so... basically, data's relative |immutability| over time
becomes its own Memory management awareness system.

With the interconnectedness of the Watch/Medical project, I imagine folks will want the OS 
core improvements that come from that massive amount of location data... unsaleable
without a "Blue Ocean" type business (medical technology and safety seem pretty safe as usual),
but very easily proactive within an OS' internal memory management systems. This should lead
to a massive amount of leverage for getting greater triangulations on GPS coordinates, but then again,
when we connect the alarm systems (if, ugh...) with the vocals, locs, etc, the triangulations should be 
amazingly easy. 

... more to come...
